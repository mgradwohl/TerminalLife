# TerminalLife
Conway's game of life in C++ outputs to Terminal

This was a project after Mexican food. I learned C++ before C++ 11/14/17/20 so I'm brushing up on my skills.
This project is purely an exercise of new things, and was fun.

Code compiles in MSVC 2022 (aka v17) and outputs to Windows Terminal on Windows 11.
Get Windows terminal with "winget install Microsoft.WindowsTerminal"
